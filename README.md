## 🧮 Shape Area (Node.js, CommonJS)

It provides a simple **area calculator** for circles and squares using pure functions, while emphasizing Node.js **CommonJS modules**—**exporting** with `module.exports` and **importing** with `require()`. This project demonstrates clear function design (`circleArea()` for `πr²`, `squareArea()` for `s²`), **object destructuring** on import, and clean console output for quick verification.

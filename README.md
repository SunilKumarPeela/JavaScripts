## 🌡️ Temperature Converter 

Temperature Converter is my first JavaScript project.  
It takes a temperature in **Kelvin** and converts it into **Celsius**, **Fahrenheit**, and **Newton** scales, with clean and styled console output.

## 🐶 Human Age to Dog Years Converter

It takes an age in **human years** and converts it into **dog years** using the rule that the first two human years count as **10.5 dog years each** and every year after that counts as **4 dog years**, then displays the result with a clean console output.
